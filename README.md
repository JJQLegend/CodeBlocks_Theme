CodeBlocks_Theme
================

My Theme and Vim Theme

Save the files you'd like as the format of .conf. I'd rather you try each of them for a better visual feeling. Use cb_share_config.exe to utilize these .confs. The cb_share_config.exe is in the default folder of the Code::Blocks Installation Path.
Enjoy!
